# Active_particles-LAMMPS
I have attempeted to simulate active matter with help of LAMMPS. And though the code is not totally cleean and ready and there needs to be more attempts to make this more flexible.

##Instuctions
* The code can be built in the same way as the normal LAMMPS. The script required to run is in.msd.2d. 
* Dr(radial diffusivity) can be tuned via the mass, $$Dr\propto\frac{1}{mass}$$
* Vp is controlled reandom number seed in fix langevin. vp = seed/1000

##More details to be added soon.
